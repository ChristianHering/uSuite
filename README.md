About
-----

This project doesn't really do much. It does file based user authentication, session management, and provides a simple 'hands off' API for building extensions.

Currently, there are no extensions availible for uSuite.

Installing and Compiling from Source
------------

Since uSuite is source based, you're going to need the following in order to compile it:

  * [Go](https://golang.org) installed and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install)
  * Any extensions you want already merged into uSuite
  * A little patience :)

Contributing
------------

Contributions are always welcome. If you're interested in contributing, send me an email or submit a PR.
